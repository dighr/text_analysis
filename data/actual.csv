I don't think that the statment he will be for 100 yrs... I don't think he meant it.  We still have people in other countries for other reasons after the war, but they are not there because we are fighting.  I think his health could play an issue, I don't like that he will tax medical... right thing or Obama... I don't know. His wife looks phony, she doesn't come across elegant, like a president's wife.

I don't think he is a good person for a republican president... if they had someone desent like... can't remember, she very smart not as attractive as palin... but he did not pick her.  Palin is very extreme in the way she thinks and does things.  Also my father is 82, always republican, will vote for obama now.  the health crysis is like a 5,000 and we will be taxed and it is not going to work.  I read people that are wealthy and they are also voting for obama and that makes you think he's got it together.  It concerns me, I had a friend who had to go to war, she had a life, got married and sent her off even though she was in the reserves.  alexa burgess... she had to go and leave her children and husband behind. People that volunteer it's fine, but why force people to go.  It is amazing, outstanding.  He is too right wing, if he does become president he will pick court justices that are right wing.  Who is him to say what is the right to do for a woman with her own body.  nobody is as privileged as his wife or palin's daughter... govmt should not get involved in that.  that should be their choice, not ruled by govmt.
