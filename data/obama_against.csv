I think we should end the war, the money we spend monthly for the war is ludicrous.  he does not a plan.  picking Palin killed it.  he had cancer but he might not make it.  he could die.  she is not qualified to be VP.  Palin is not Hillary.  his wife not knowing how many houses he has, he should know, if he had nuclear buttons... would he know which one to punch? His first wife injured, became paralyzed and when he got back he divorced her and when with Cindy, she has money, and this could have been his motivation.  divorcing his wife was not very loyal.  the more I see him, I see him very angry with Obama, making faces gestures, mocking Obama, rolling eyes... I don't think he is a good person for a republican president... if they had someone descent like... can't remember, she very smart not as attractive as Palin... but he did not pick her.  Palin is very extreme in the way she thinks and does things.  Also my father is 82, always republican, will vote for Obama now.  the health crisis is like a 5,000 and we will be taxed and it is not going to work.  I read people that are wealthy and they are also voting for Obama and that makes you think he's got it together.  It concerns me, I had a friend who had to go to war, she had a life, got married and sent her off even though she was in the reserves.  Alexa burgess... she had to go and leave her children and husband behind. People that volunteer it's fine, but why force people to go.  It is amazing, outstanding.  He is too right wing, if he does become president he will pick court justices that are right wing.  Who is him to say what is the right to do for a woman with her own body.  nobody is as privileged as his wife or Palin's daughter... government should not get involved in that.  that should be their choice, not ruled by government.  They should stay out of the abortion issue.  He wants to freeze spending.
