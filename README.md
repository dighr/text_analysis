# Text Analysis
In this project, we aim to categorize survey responses as shown in the example below
![Alt text](examples/example1.png?raw=true "Example")
## Proposed Solution
- Obtaining Survey Responses data:
- Feature Extraction: 
    transform each text into a numerical representation in the form of a vector
- Clustering using K-Mean or any other clustering methods
- Labelling each cluster manually
- Determining which cluster new sentences belongs to and assigning it to that cluster
